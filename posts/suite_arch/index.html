I originally hoped to maintain a weekly release schedule, but then the following happened:</p><ul><li>Announcements of foreign economic policies, which frequently changed direction, sent the algorithm into a temporary state of disarray</li><li>Prices recently went parabolic in the crypto market, not necessarily to favorable effect</li><li>I embarked on migrating my entire local setup to AWS, which is a whole ordeal in itself</li><li>I went window shopping for datasets<ul><li>I couldn&rsquo;t find any datasets I liked with the right frequency and features, so I had to make my own<ul><li>I had to create my own data pipelines to ensure consistency and reliability of the data getting ingested</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Thanks to a co-worker of mine, I also came to the conclusion that raw posts on LinkedIn would limit the amount of information I could share. That led to the creation of this blog site and infrastructure to support it (major shout-out to <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank>Hugo</a>
for making this whole process a breeze). Thanks, Mike!</p><p>So now the question begs, what did I work on since my last LinkedIn post? To summarize, here is an overview of what is currently set up in my AWS account—all built since my previous update:</p><p><img src=/blog-site/posts/suite_arch/images/crypto_suite_aws_large.png alt="Suite Architecture"></p><h3 id=merging-architectures>Merging Architectures</h3><p>While I was building out Crypto Compass, I realized that I was repeatedly reusing architecture and scripts from older projects of mine, including one that generated an AI-driven crypto newspaper based on recent price movements. While I had at one point abandoned this project, I realized I could easily bring it back and launch it on top of the architecture I was already building out for Crypto Compass. Concurrently, I began developing a second application—a fully automated crypto trading bot.</p><p>This conversion led to the complete evolution of what I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish; an entire suite of applications based on one technical analysis algorithm that I can expand on top of with something as little as a spark of imagination.</p><p>So, what do all these projects even do?</p><h4 id=crypto-compass>Crypto Compass</h4><p>Crypto Compass is built off of a few different price predictors for short-term (and now near-term) price movements. It uses:</p><ul><li>A raw technical analysis algorithm utilizing advanced mathematics to produce a score, prediction, and various other important metrics to keep track of</li><li>An AI Powered version of the same technical analysis algorithm, but it has been trained on historical data in an attempt to provide a more accurate prediction. This model pipeline is also capable of retraining itself on new data, in an effort to keep up with latest market trends.</li><li>An AI powered version of the same technical analysis algorithm, but it incorporates real time news data to provide a more accurate prediction. This output also incorporates the raw non-AI powered algorithm in case the AI model&rsquo;s prediction is too far off from the raw algorithm&rsquo;s prediction, or vice versa. This is really meant to provide a user with various predictions they can choose from, and see how they compare to one another.</li></ul><h4 id=crypto-trading-bot>Crypto Trading Bot</h4><p>Sitting inside of the AWS Lambda Step Function is now an additional lambda function that uses the output of Crypto Compass&rsquo; algorithms to make trades on a centralized exchange (CEX); the name of which I will disclose at a later date. This trading bot is able to keep track of a plethora of metrics to ensure efficient trading strategies and lower tax liabilities. I&rsquo;m very excited to share how this bot works at a later date and will dedicate a whole post to it. What started out as simple buy/sell logic quickly evolved into something much more complex, though I&rsquo;m still simulating price performance and have not yet given it access to real money. For now, it runs in my AWS account with imaginary funds, but it&rsquo;s exciting to watch every day!</p><h4 id=crypto-newspapers>Crypto Newspapers</h4><p>I still can&rsquo;t believe I resurrected this project. I had completely abandoned it late last year, but now it&rsquo;s back and better than ever. This project also deserves its own blog post, so I&rsquo;ll save deep diving into this for another day. However, at a high level, this project uses live historic price data (really just from the past 24 hours, and any other time in the dataset that is deemed relevant) and uses AI models to generate a newspaper-esque output that can be used by traders to make decisions or just for fun. Utilizing both an AI Image Generator and an AI Text Generator, this project is able to stay self-sufficient and generate a new newspaper every day without any human intervention.</p><p>So, that&rsquo;s all for now. I just wanted to stop by and say, hey, I&rsquo;ve got a blog now and look at all this cool stuff! I&rsquo;ll start sharing more in-depth analyses of my work in the coming weeks, as I originally planned to do. Stay tuned for next week, when I will spotlight a critical pathway in my architecture diagram and offer an exclusive glimpse under the hood.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
