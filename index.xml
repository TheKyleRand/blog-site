I originally hoped to maintain a weekly release schedule, but then the following happened:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Announcements of foreign economic policies, which frequently changed direction, sent the algorithm into a temporary state of disarray&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prices recently went parabolic in the crypto market, not necessarily to favorable effect&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I embarked on migrating my entire local setup to AWS, which is a whole ordeal in itself&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I went window shopping for datasets
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any datasets I liked with the right frequency and features, so I had to make my own
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I had to create my own data pipelines to ensure consistency and reliability of the data getting ingested&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Thanks to a co-worker of mine, I also came to the conclusion that raw posts on LinkedIn would limit the amount of information I could share. That led to the creation of this blog site and infrastructure to support it (major shout-out to &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" >Hugo&lt;/a>
 for making this whole process a breeze). Thanks, Mike!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
