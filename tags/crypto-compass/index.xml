I thought I&amp;rsquo;d be able to keep up with a weekly release schedule, but then the following happened:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Foreign economic policies kept getting announced and flip-flopped causing the algo to go haywaire for a bit&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prices recently went parabolic in the crypto market, though not in a great way&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I started migrating my entire local setup to AWS, which is a whole ordeal in itself&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I had to go window shopping for datasets
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any datasets I liked with the right frequency and features, so I had to make my own
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I had to create my own data pipelines to ensure consistency and reliability of the data getting ingested&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Thanks to a co-worker of mine, I also came to the conclusion that raw posts on LinkedIn would limit the amount of information I could share. That led to the creation of this blog site and infrastructure to support it (major shout-out to &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> for making this whole process a breeze).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
